Step 1: Extract and/or copy the extracted files to a location which is accessible through the web server you intend to use. This should be the final location as well.

For the purposes of this file, we'll assume the installation happens at the directory "." and is accessible through http://example.com/kisakone/ ,

Step 2: You need to make sure config.php in the installation root directory can be written to by the web server.

Step 3: Access the page install.php in the installation root using your browser, in the example that would be http://example.com/kisakone/install.php

Step 4: Enter the requested details and submit the form

Step 5: It is recommended, although not strictly necessary to prevent the web server from writing to config.php again

Step 6: The directory ui/elements/uploaded needs to be made writable by the web server

Step 7: If using mod_rewrite, adjust the RewriteBase setting in .htaccess manually to refer to the installation path (as seen on the web server)
