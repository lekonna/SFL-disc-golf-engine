Setting up Kisakone:
--------------------
Step 1: Extract and/or copy the extracted files to a location which is accessible 
through the web server you intend to use. This should be the final location as well.

For the purposes of this file, we'll assume the installation happens at the 
directory "." and is accessible through http://example.com/kisakone/ 

Step 2: You need to make sure config.php in the installation root directory can be 
written to by the web server.

Step 3: Have a database available in mysql, or create one for Kisakone. Installation
process will not create one for you.

Step 4: Access the page install.php in the installation root using your browser, 
in the example that would be http://example.com/kisakone/install.php

Step 5: Enter the requested details and submit the form

Step 6: It is recommended, although not strictly necessary to prevent the web 
server from writing to config.php again.

Step 7: The directory ui/elements/uploaded and Smarty/templetes_c needs to be 
writable by the web server.

Step 8: If using mod_rewrite, adjust the RewriteBase setting in .htaccess manually 
to refer to the installation path (as seen on the web server).


Setting up LAMP for Kisakone:
-----------------------------

In Ubuntu:
Good generic guide for setting LAMP:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP

Step by step:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server apache2 libapache2-mod-php5
sudo a2enmod php5
sudo a2enmod rewrite

Edit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default to point to your local sources.

sudo service apach2 restart


Using VagrantUp as development:
-------------------------------

VagrantUp is a headless virtual machine that can be instantiated and destroyed 
at a whim, to be recreated identically again. This way it can provide exact same
development environment for all developers. System works on Linux, Windows, Mac 
etc, so host is not an issue. You just ssh in to your vagrantup box.

Steps to run development on vagrantup:

1) Install VagrantUp for your host: vagrantup.com
2) Install Virtualbox and Extensions: virtualbox.org
3) In Kisakone git, go to tools/vagrantup/apache2, execute 'vagrant up'
4) When it says it has completed, execute 'vagrant ssh' to have shell to your
   installation. 'sudo' is passwordless for you. 
5) Webroot is set to /kisakone, which is shared from Kisakone folder from your host,
   so you can edit files your host with your favourite editor and it is synced
   to vagrant automatically.
6) Create database in mysql, mysql pass is 'pass'
7) Go to Kisakone installation guide on top of this file, but use port 10080!
8) Hack & enjoy.
